<h1 lcass="">Welcome to Caregiver Connection.</h1>
<p>Caregiver Connection is a way for travel nurses to find rides and make friendships. Our goal is to provide an application which allows verified registared nurses to connect with other verified RNs and easily set up rides to work, depending on the user's hospital assignment and shifts. Furthermore, a favorite list of nurses and an in-app ride scheduling feature allows for easy ridesharing to and from work!</p>
